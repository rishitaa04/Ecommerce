For frontend :

To install node modules for a project, you typically use the npm (Node Package Manager) command in your terminal or command prompt. Here's a brief overview of the steps:

Navigate to Your Project Directory: Open your terminal or command prompt and change the directory (cd) to where your project is located. For example:

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/project
Install Node Modules: Once you're in your project directory, use the following command to install all the dependencies listed in your package.json file:

Copy code
npm install
This command reads the package.json file in your project directory and installs all the dependencies listed under dependencies and devDependencies.


and the npm start run


For backend : 

To set up a backend using Node.js with MongoDB for database and JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication, you'll need to follow a series of steps. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

1. Install Node.js
First, make sure Node.js is installed on your system.

2. Initialize Your Node.js Project
Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run:
cd my-backend-app
npm init -y
This will create a new Node.js project and generate a package.json file with default settings (-y flag accepts all defaults).

3. Install Required Packages
Install necessary packages such as express (for server), mongodb (for MongoDB connectivity), jsonwebtoken (for JWT authentication), and bcryptjs (for password hashing):
npm install express mongodb jsonwebtoken bcryptjs
These packages will help you set up a basic server, connect to MongoDB, handle JWT authentication, and securely hash passwords.


4. Set Up MongoDB
Install MongoDB: Install MongoDB on your local machine or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.
Connect to MongoDB: Use the MongoDB Node.js driver to connect to your MongoDB database.


5. Implement JWT Authentication
